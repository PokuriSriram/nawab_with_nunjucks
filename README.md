Component Collection: Explored Bootstrap documentation to identify and extract Navbars, Cards, and Hero layouts.

Polishing: Applied custom CSS for arch-top image shapes and a high-contrast Emerald/Gold palette to ensure visual appeal and responsiveness.

Tools & Resources
Framework: Bootstrap 5.

Documentation: Official Bootstrap Examples and utility class docs.
